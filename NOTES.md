## üåê Vertex Shader

- It is basically a program that will run for every vertex throughout our geometry.
- Responsible for placing all the vertices in the correct position to create all objects.

<hr>

Note that you can calculate the position of a vertex in the vertex shader by:

`gl_Position = projectionMatrix * modelViewMatrix * vec4( position, 1.0 );`

or alternatively,

`gl_Position = projectionMatrix * viewMatrix * modelMatrix * vec4( position, 1.0 );`

## üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà Fragment Shader

- It is basically a program that will loop over every pixel in between the vertices and set its color to some value.
- Responsible for filling in the space in between the vertices.

<hr>

Note that you can assign a color (red in this case) to all the pixels by:

`gl_FragColor = vec4(1, 0, 0, 1);`

## üåç Adding a texture to a geometry

### 1. Getting a texture from an image to fragment shader:

- We can get the texture for the globe by passing the image through **uniforms** (similar to props from react).

_app.js_

```js
const sphereMat = new THREE.ShaderMaterial({
  vertexShader: vertexShader,
  fragmentShader: fragmentShader,
  uniforms: {
    globeTexture: { value: loader.load(globeTexture) },
  },
});
```

_fragment.glsl_

```
uniform sampler2D globeTexture;
```

### 2. Getting the uv value from vertex shader to fragment shader:

#### What is a uv?

- A uv is an x and y coordinate. Eg: [0, 0]
- u and v are texture coordinates. They represent the axes of the 2d texture.
- uv mapping is the process of mapping a 2d image onto a 3d object

<hr>

_vertex.glsl_

```
varying vec2 vertexUV; // vUV

void main() {
    vertexUV = uv;
}
```

_fragment.glsl_

```
varying vec2 vertexUV;
```

### 3. Adding texture to fragment shader:

Use the image texture and uv value from above steps.

_fragment.glsl_

```
uniform sampler2D globeTexture;
varying vec2 vertexUV; // vUV

void main() {
    gl_FragColor = texture2D(globeTexture, vertexUV);
}
```
